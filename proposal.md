## Description
A dice rolling game where you must predict outcomes and take risks. Also has event cards that enhance gameplay experience. Was a game my friend and I came up with almost a decade ago, and now I may have the skills to code it.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Player vs player gameplay
- Feature 2
	- Working points/money(?) system
- Feature 3 
	- Core gameplay loop of event cards and dice rolling


## Challenges
- Implementation of 2 player input/maybe creation of rudimentary AI to play against
- Proper visuals
- Math to determine money distribution based on odds 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, I'd want to have a fully functioning game with some level of visuals. Maybe even expand to allow for 4 players

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Having a working core gameplay loop without the cards system
