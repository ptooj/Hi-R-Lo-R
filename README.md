## Description
A dice rolling game where you must predict outcomes and take risks. Was a game my friend and I came up with almost a decade ago, and now I may have the skills to code it.

##Rules
Both players start out with $100. You lose if you run out of money, and you win if you get $250. P1 starts with a dice that must be rolled. After rolling, the player will decide whether their next roll will be higher or lower than their first. After deciding, you roll again. They amount of money received scales with the odds of the roll. EX: betting lower after rolling a 4 will net a smaller amount of money compared to betting higher if you win. The safer the bet, the more money you'll lose if you're wrong as well. 

##Secret
Pressing Q on the roll prompt screen will toggle an ai to play as P2.
